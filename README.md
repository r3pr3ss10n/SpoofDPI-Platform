# SpoofDPI-Platform

## Archived
SpoofDPI binary latest update was nearly 7 months ago (at the time of 10.04.2025), and it doesn't work due to DPI technologies update. Therefore, there's no point in this application. 
I suggest trying other variants like ByeDPI and others.

**SpoofDPI-Platform** is a solution for bypassing DPI-based internet restrictions. It serves as a user-friendly wrapper for the [SpoofDPI](https://github.com/xvzc/SpoofDPI).

For the Russian version of this README, click [here](https://github.com/r3pr3ss10n/SpoofDPI-Platform/blob/main/README_ru.md) ðŸ‡·ðŸ‡º.

**Supported Platforms:**
- Android
- MacOS (Both Intel and Apple Silicon chip)
- Windows (amd64 only. No arm support)

## Getting Started

1. **Install the Application**: Download and install SpoofDPI-Platform from the provided link.
2. **Launch the App**: Open the app and click the "Start Service" button to activate it.

**Advanced Users**: You can customize settings such as DNS address or window size according to needed preferences.

## Notes

### Android
No root access is required! SpoofDPI-Platform operates in VPN mode.

### MacOS
App works in system proxy mode.

### Windows
Works in system proxy mode. If bypassing works on MacOS/Android on the same network, but doesn't on Windows, then try to slightly increase Window size parameter.
